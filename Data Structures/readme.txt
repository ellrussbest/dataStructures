The following are the class headers that you can find in c++ programming

1. #include <climits>
	This header file is used when we want to use the unsigned int or float.
	e.g. int sum(unsigned int x);
		int x = UINT_MAX; or int x = INT_MAX;
	This header can also be used when we want to convert string to int
	e.g. stoi(str)
2. #include <sstream>
	This header file is used when we want to convert integers to a string.
	e.g. stringstream newInstance;
		newIntance<<int;
		newInstance>>str;
