/**
The above example is an example of pass by reference. 

When we pass a reference to an object as a function parameter, we are passing the object itself rather than a copy of the object. 
This means that any changes made to the object inside the function will also affect the original object outside the function.

In contrast, pass by value involves passing a copy of the object as a function parameter. 
This means that any changes made to the object inside the function will not affect the original object outside the function.

In the example I showed you, the function `func` takes a reference to an integer `x`. 
This means that any changes made to `x` inside the function will affect the original integer `num` outside the function.

In C++, double asterisks (`**`) are used to declare a pointer to a pointer. This is also called a "pointer-to-pointer" or "double pointer".

You might use a double pointer when you want to create a pointer that can point to another pointer. 
This can be useful in situations where you need to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array or when you want to pass a pointer to a function that needs to modify the original pointer.

Here's an example of how you might use a double pointer to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array:

```
int rows = 3;
int cols = 4;

// Allocate memory for the 2D array
int** array2D = new int*[rows];
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    /** not the use of the NEW key world during the declaration of the columns **/
    array2D[i] = new int[cols];
}

// Initialize the array
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        array2D[i][j] = i * cols + j;
    }
}

// Use the array
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        cout << array2D[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

// Free the memory
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    delete[] array2D[i];
}
delete[] array2D;
```

In this example, we first allocate an array of pointers to `int` using a single asterisk (`*`).
We then use a loop to allocate memory for each row of the 2D array. Finally, we use nested loops to initialize and print the values of the array.

When we're done using the array, we need to free the memory by calling `delete[]` on each row pointer and then on the array pointer itself.

so does it mean that anything that we pass by a pointer is pass by reference in c++

No, passing a pointer to a function in C++ is not the same as passing a reference to a function. 

When you pass a pointer to a function, you are passing a copy of the pointer, which means the function can modify the data pointed to by the pointer, but it cannot modify the pointer itself. 

When you pass a reference to a function, you are passing a reference to the original variable, which means the function can modify the variable itself, not just the data it points to.

Here's an example:

```
void modifyPointer(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 42;   // modifies the data pointed to by ptr
    ptr = nullptr;   // does not modify the original pointer
}

void modifyReference(int& ref) {
    ref = 42;   // modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int value = 0;
    int* ptr = &value;

    modifyPointer(ptr);
    cout << *ptr << endl;   // prints 42

    modifyReference(value);
    cout << value << endl;   // prints 42
}
```

In this example, we define two functions, `modifyPointer` and `modifyReference`, that take a pointer and a reference, respectively. 

In `modifyPointer`, we modify the data pointed to by the pointer, but we do not modify the pointer itself. In `modifyReference`, we modify the original variable using the reference.

In `main`, we create an integer variable `value` and a pointer `ptr` that points to it. We then call `modifyPointer` and `modifyReference` with `ptr` and `value`, respectively. 

After calling `modifyPointer`, we print the value pointed to by `ptr` and see that it has been modified to 42. After calling `modifyReference`, we print `value` and see that it has also been modified to 42.

so if i'm getting it right, you can modify the value in a function that accepts a pointer as a parameter but you cannot modify the pointer itself.
MY AI
Yes, that's correct! When you pass a pointer to a function, you are passing a copy of the pointer, which means the function can modify the data pointed to by the pointer, but it cannot modify the pointer itself. 

To modify the pointer itself, you need to pass a pointer to the pointer. This is sometimes called a "double pointer" or a "pointer to a pointer". Here's an example:

```
void modifyPointer(int** ptrPtr) {
    *ptrPtr = nullptr;   // modifies the original pointer
}

int main() {
    int value = 0;
    int* ptr = &value;

    modifyPointer(&ptr);
    cout << ptr << endl;   // prints 0x0
}
```

In this example, we define a function `modifyPointer` that takes a pointer to a pointer. Inside the function, we set the value of the pointer to `nullptr`, which modifies the original pointer.

In `main`, we create an integer variable `value` and a pointer `ptr` that points to it. We then call `modifyPointer` with a pointer to `ptr`. After calling `modifyPointer`, 
we print the value of `ptr` and see that it has been modified to `nullptr`.
